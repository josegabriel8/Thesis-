## Overview

This study looked at a treatment called DaraVD for people with a type of cancer called multiple myeloma who didn't respond to a previous drug, lenalidomide. The researchers found that the treatment worked well for most patients, with 84.7% showing improvement. It was also safe to use, with the average patient living without their cancer getting worse for 14 months. The study suggests that DaraVD is a good option for treating this kind of cancer when other treatments don't work.

## Abstract
The management of lenalidomide-refractory (Len-R) multiple myeloma (MM) patients presents significant clinical challenges, necessitating effective therapeutic strategies. The daratumumabbortezomib-dexamethasone (DaraVD) has been widely employed in this context. This multicenter observational study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of DaraVD exclusively in Len-R MM patients. A cohort of 85 patients with relapsed or refractory MM, all previously exposed to lenalidomide, was analyzed. The overall response rate was 84.7%, with 60.0% achieving a very good partial response (VGPR) or better. The regimen demonstrated a manageable safety profile. Median progression-free survival was 14 months, and overall survival was 47 months at a median follow-up of 22 months. Stratified survival analyses highlighted significant associations between key variables such as extramedullary disease, response depth, ECOG performance status, and Urinary proteins level, underscoring their impact on outcomes. These findings support DaraVD as a viable treatment option for Len-R MM patients, warranting its consideration in clinical practice to improve patient outcomes.
